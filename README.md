#Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project

##Smart Contract for bets
* Users will be able to bet on soccer matches through a smart contract.
* The bet can be in two ways:
 * "by result" of the match (winner or draw)
 * "by number of goals" that each team will score.
* Winning a bet "by result" will give 3 points.
* Winning a bet "by number of goals" will give 5 points.
* Users can bet in both ways simultaneously, achieving a maximum of 8 points per game.
* The bets will be weekly and the 10 users with the most points will win.

##Workflow
1. Users will have to register themselves somehow on the contract
2. The user places his bet opting for a winning team or for a draw and the number of goals of each team.
3. At the end of the game, the points of each user will be calculated.
4. The points obtained will be added to those already achieved in the week.
5. The leaderboard will be updated.
